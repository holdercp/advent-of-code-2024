# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'm solving problems in C.

I've been backfiling gaps in my computer science knowledge this past year and I've [been inspired](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/the-cost-of-forsaking-c-113986438784) to program much closer to the machine's hardware.

The goal for this year is not to finish all 25 days (although that would be a nice bonus) but to better learn how a computer works. Not having the level of abstraction I'm used to should prove to be quite challenging but I'm ready for it.

Merry Christmas!
